# Sample ERC-20 Project

This project demonstrates a basic ERC-20 Token creation use case.

It makes use of:

- Hardhat
- Alchemy API
- OpenZepplin ERC-20 standard

and requires Goerli Testnet Ethers.

Implementation Steps:

Key steps to implement the ERC-20 token are:

1. Set up the project by installing Hardhat and creating a new project directory.
2. Obtain an Alchemy API key and configure the project's .env file.
3. Create the ERC-20 contract file with the desired token name.
4. Define the contract's initial supply and customize other parameters.
5. Deploy the ERC-20 token to the Goerli test network using the deployment script.
6. Verify the deployment on the Goerli Etherscan.
7. Interact with the deployed ERC-20 token by sending tokens or querying balances.

Please note that this is a simplified summary of the key steps involved.
